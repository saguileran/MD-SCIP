# Python Notebooks

Some collab notebooks used here are taken and adapted from the [making-it-rain](https://github.com/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain) project. The other are created using the python libraries [PyEMMA](http://www.emma-project.org/latest/).

The input and output files are stored in Google Drive, [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Y47kHxs4rIxJ09D5U_knSuA4c3D5IR3?usp=share_link), to get acces to them please sent a message to [saguileran@unal.edu.co](https://maito:saguileran@unal.edu.co)
