abstract = {Mechanistic aspects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation. Aldosterone exerts its biological effects through binding to mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Ligand binding induces a receptor transconformation within the ligand-binding domain and dissociation of associated proteins from the receptor. The ligand-activated receptor binds as a dimer to the response elements present in the promoter region of target genes and initiates the transcription through specific interactions with the transcription machinery. The glucocorticoid hormone cortisol binds to the human MR (hMR) with the same affinity as aldosterone, but is less efficient than aldosterone in stimulating the hMR transactivation. The antimineralocorticoid spirolactones also bind to the hMR but induce a receptor conformation that is transcriptionally silent. In this report, we describe the key residues involved in the recognition of agonist and antagonist ligands and propose a two-step model with a dynamic dimension for the MR activation. In its unliganded state, MR is in an opened conformation in which folding into the ligand-binding competent state requires both the heat shock protein 90 and the C-terminal part of the receptor. An intermediate complex is generated by ligand binding, leading to a more compact receptor conformation. This transient complex is then converted to a transcriptionally active conformation in which stability depends on the steroid-receptor contacts.}

abstract = {Hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension are major public health problems of largely unknown causes. We describe a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), S810L, that causes early-onset hypertension that is markedly exacerbated in pregnancy. This mutation results in constitutive MR activity and alters receptor specificity, with progesterone and other steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. Structural and biochemical studies indicate that the mutation results in the gain of a van der Waals interaction between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes for interaction of the steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the wild-type receptor. This helix 5–helix 3 interaction is highly conserved among diverse nuclear hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in receptor activation.}

abstract = {Aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptors: Orphan questions. Classically, mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are activated by aldosterone to promote unidirectional transepithelial sodium transport. Activation of MR in nonepithelial tissues has been shown to elevate blood pressure (central nervous system; CNS) and to cause hypertrophy and fibrosis (heart). For both epithelial and nonepithelial tissues, there remain a variety of questions regarding MR which are not only unanswered but also essentially not addressed. Seven such questions include: (1) how the physiologic glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone) can mimic aldosterone action in epithelial MR, but act as antagonists in the heart and AV3V region; (2) how salt facilitates the nonepithelial, pathophysiologic effects of aldosterone; (3) how aldosterone activates unprotected AV3V MR in the face of orders of magnitude higher circulating glucocorticoid concentrations; (4) how unprotected nonepithelial MR act as “always occupied” receptors in guinea pigs and other species; (5) how, when 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 is active, epithelial MR occupied by physiologic glucocorticoids appear transcriptionally inactive; (6) how aldosterone activates epithelial MR in the face of approximately 103-fold higher glucocorticoid levels, plasma binding and 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity notwithstanding; and (7) how aldosterone produces changes in urinary [K+] before [Na+].}

Expression studies demonstrate its ability to bind aldosterone with high affinity and to activate gene transcription in response to aldosterone, thus establishing its identity as the human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR). This molecule also shows high affinity for glucocorticoids and stimulates a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter. Together the hMR and hGR provide unexpected functional diversity in which hormone-binding properties, target gene interactions, and patterns of tissue-specific expression may be used in a combinatorial fashion to achieve complex physiologic control.}

The structures reveal how the receptor forms an asymmetric dimer on the DNA and provide a detailed view of the domain interactions within and across the two monomers. Hydrogen--deuterium exchange and DNA-binding experiments demonstrate that ligand-dependent structural changes are communicated across the different domains in the full-length receptor. This study demonstrates how GR forms a distinct architecture on DNA and how signal transmission can be modulated by the ligand pharmacophore, provides a platform to build a new level of understanding of how receptor modifications can drive disease progression and offers key insight for future drug design.},

To address this challenge, we have developed a new computational method {\textquotedblleft}LiGaMD{\textquotedblright}, which selectively boosts the ligand non-bonded interaction potential energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique. Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD_Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the β-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD simulations. The calculated binding free energies of guest molecules with sufficient sampling agreed excellently with experimental data (\&lt; 1.0 kcal/mol error). In comparison with previous microsecond-timescale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers{\textquoteright} rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 μs simulations. The calculated ligand binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a promising approach for characterizing ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to facilitate computer-aided drug design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {Estrogen Receptor (ER) is an important target for pharmaceutical design. Like other ligand-dependent transcription factors, hormone binding regulates ER transcriptional activity. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which ligands enter and leave ERs and other nuclear receptors remain poorly understood. Here, we report results of locally enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to identify dissociation pathways of two ER ligands [the natural hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) and the selective ER modulator raloxifene (RAL)] from the human ERα ligand-binding domain in monomeric and dimeric forms. E2 dissociation occurs via three different pathways in ER monomers. One resembles the mousetrap mechanism (Path I), involving repositioning of helix 12 (H12), others involve the separation of H8 and H11 (Path II), and a variant of this pathway at the bottom of the ligand-binding domain (Path II′). RAL leaves the receptor through Path I and a Path I variant in which the ligand leaves the receptor through the loop region between H11 and H12 (Path I′). Remarkably, ER dimerization strongly suppresses Paths II and II′ for E2 dissociation and modifies RAL escape routes. We propose that differences in ligand release pathways detected in the simulations for ER monomers and dimers provide an explanation for previously observed effects of ER quaternary state on ligand dissociation rates and suggest that dimerization may play an important, and hitherto unexpected, role in regulation of ligand dissociation rates throughout the nuclear receptor family.},

abstract={Methodologies on molecular docking are constantly improving. The problem consists on finding an optimal interplay between the computational cost and a satisfactory physical description of ligand-receptor interaction. In pursuit of an advance in current methods we developed a mixed docking approach combining ligand- and receptor-based strategies in a docking engine, where tridimensional descriptors for shape and charge distribution of a reference ligand guide the initial placement of the docking molecule and an interaction energy-based global minimization follows. This hybrid docking was evaluated with soft-core and force field potentials taking into account ligand pose and scoring. Our approach was found to be competitive to a purely receptor-based dock resulting in improved logAUC values when evaluated with DUD and DUD-E. Furthermore, the smoothed potential as evaluated here, was not advantageous when ligand binding poses were compared to experimentally determined conformations. In conclusion we show that a combination of ligand- and receptor-based strategy docking with a force field energy model results in good reproduction of binding poses and enrichment of active molecules against decoys. This strategy is implemented in our tool, LiBELa, available to the scientific community.},

abstract = {The correct evaluation of ligand binding free energies by computational methods is still a very challenging active area of research. The most employed methods for these calculations can be roughly classified into four groups: (i) the fastest and less accurate methods, such as molecular docking, designed to sample a large number of molecules and rapidly rank them according to the potential binding energy; (ii) the second class of methods use a thermodynamic ensemble, typically generated by molecular dynamics, to analyze the endpoints of the thermodynamic cycle for binding and extract differences, in the so-called ‘end-point’ methods; (iii) the third class of methods is based on the Zwanzig relationship and computes the free energy difference after a chemical change of the system (alchemical methods); and (iv) methods based on biased simulations, such as metadynamics, for example. These methods require increased computational power and as expected, result in increased accuracy for the determination of the strength of binding. Here, we describe an intermediate approach, based on the Monte Carlo Recursion (MCR) method first developed by Harold Scheraga. In this method, the system is sampled at increasing effective temperatures, and the free energy of the system is assessed from a series of terms W(b,T), computed from Monte Carlo (MC) averages at each iteration. We show the application of the MCR for ligand binding with datasets of guest-hosts systems (N = 75) and we observed that a good correlation is obtained between experimental data and the binding energies computed with MCR. We also compared the experimental data with an end-point calculation from equilibrium Monte Carlo calculations that allowed us to conclude that the lower-energy (lower-temperature) terms in the calculation are the most relevant to the estimation of the binding energies, resulting in similar correlations between MCR and MC data and the experimental values. On the other hand, the MCR method provides a reasonable view of the binding energy funnel, with possible connections with the ligand binding kinetics, as well. The codes developed for this analysis are publicly available on GitHub as a part of the LiBELa/MCLiBELa project (https://github.com/alessandronascimento/LiBELa).}

ABSTRACT={The precise modeling of molecular interactions remains an important goal among molecular modeling techniques. Some of the challenges in the field include the precise definition of a Hamiltonian for biomolecular systems, together with precise parameters derived from Molecular Mechanics Force Fields, for example. The problem is even more challenging when interaction energies from different species are computed, such as the interaction energy involving a ligand and a protein, given that small differences must be computed from large energies. Here we evaluated the effects of the electrostatic model for ligand binding energy evaluation in the context of ligand docking. For this purpose, a classical Coulomb potential with distance-dependent dielectrics was compared with a Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model for electrostatic potential computation, based on DelPhi calculations. We found that, although the electrostatic energies were highly correlated for the Coulomb and PB models, the ligand pose and the enrichment of actual ligands against decoy compounds, were improved when binding energies were computed using PB as compared to the Coulomb model. We observed that the electrostatic energies computed with the Coulomb model were, on average, ten times larger than the energies computed with the PB model, suggesting a strong overestimation of the polar interactions in the Coulomb model. We also found that a slightly smoothed Lennard-Jones potential combined with the PB model resulted in a good compromise between ligand sampling and energetic scoring.}

    abstract = {Molecular docking is an important tool for the discovery of new biologically active molecules given that the receptor structure is known. An excellent environment for the development of new methods and improvement of the current methods is being provided by the rapid growth in the number of proteins with known structure. The evaluation of the solvation energies outstands among the challenges for the modeling of the receptor-ligand interactions, especially in the context of molecular docking where a fast, though accurate, evaluation is ought to be achieved. Here we evaluated a variation of the desolvation energy model proposed by Stouten (Stouten P.F.W. et al, Molecular Simulation, 1993, 10: 97–120), or SV model. The SV model showed a linear correlation with experimentally determined solvation energies, as available in the database FreeSolv. However, when used in retrospective docking simulations using the benchmarks DUD, charged-matched DUD and DUD-Enhanced, the SV model resulted in poorer enrichments when compared to a pure force field model with no correction for solvation effects. The data provided here is consistent with other empirical solvation models employed in the context of molecular docking and indicates that a good model to account for solvent effects is still a goal to achieve. On the other hand, despite the inability to improve the enrichment of retrospective simulations, the SV solvation model showed an interesting ability to reduce the number of molecules with net charge -2 and -3 e among the top-scored molecules in a prospective test.},

ABSTRACT={The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) approach has been widely applied as an efficient and reliable free energy simulation method to model molecular recognition, such as for protein-ligand binding interactions. In this review, we focus on recent developments and applications of the MMPBSA method. The methodology review covers solvation terms, the entropy term, extensions to membrane proteins and high-speed screening, and new automation toolkits. Recent applications in various important biomedical and chemical fields are also reviewed. We conclude with a few future directions aimed at making MMPBSA a more robust and efficient method.}
