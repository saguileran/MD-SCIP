abstract = {Mechanistic aspects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation. Aldosterone exerts its biological effects through binding to mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Ligand binding induces a receptor transconformation within the ligand-binding domain and dissociation of associated proteins from the receptor. The ligand-activated receptor binds as a dimer to the response elements present in the promoter region of target genes and initiates the transcription through specific interactions with the transcription machinery. The glucocorticoid hormone cortisol binds to the human MR (hMR) with the same affinity as aldosterone, but is less efficient than aldosterone in stimulating the hMR transactivation. The antimineralocorticoid spirolactones also bind to the hMR but induce a receptor conformation that is transcriptionally silent. In this report, we describe the key residues involved in the recognition of agonist and antagonist ligands and propose a two-step model with a dynamic dimension for the MR activation. In its unliganded state, MR is in an opened conformation in which folding into the ligand-binding competent state requires both the heat shock protein 90 and the C-terminal part of the receptor. An intermediate complex is generated by ligand binding, leading to a more compact receptor conformation. This transient complex is then converted to a transcriptionally active conformation in which stability depends on the steroid-receptor contacts.}

    abstract = "{A gain of function mutation resulting in the substitution of leucine for serine at codon 810 (S810L) in the human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is responsible for early-onset hypertension that is exacerbated in pregnancy. All steroids, including progesterone, that display antagonist properties when bound to the wild-type MR are able to activate the mutant receptor (MRL810). These findings suggest that progesterone may contribute to the dramatic aggravation of hypertension in MRL810 carriers during pregnancy. However, the steroid(s) responsible for hypertension in MRL810 carriers (men and nonpregnant women) has not yet been identified. Here we show that cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, the main cortisol and corticosterone metabolites produced in the distal nephron, where sodium reabsorption stimulated by aldosterone takes place, bind with high affinity to MRL810. The potency with which cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone bind to the mutant MR contrasts sharply with their low wild-type MR-binding capacity. In addition, cotransfection assays demonstrate that cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone are potent activators of the MRL810trans-activation function. Because the plasma concentration of cortisol in humans is about 30-fold higher than that of corticosterone, these findings strongly suggest that cortisone is one of the endogenous steroids responsible for early-onset hypertension in men and nonpregnant women carrying the MRL810 mutation.}",

abstract = {Hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension are major public health problems of largely unknown causes. We describe a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), S810L, that causes early-onset hypertension that is markedly exacerbated in pregnancy. This mutation results in constitutive MR activity and alters receptor specificity, with progesterone and other steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. Structural and biochemical studies indicate that the mutation results in the gain of a van der Waals interaction between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes for interaction of the steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the wild-type receptor. This helix 5–helix 3 interaction is highly conserved among diverse nuclear hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in receptor activation.}

	abstract = {Calculations of ligand binding free energies and kinetic rates are important for drug design. However, such tasks have proven challenging in computational chemistry and biophysics. To address this challenge, we have developed a new computational method {\textquotedblleft}LiGaMD{\textquotedblright}, which selectively boosts the ligand non-bonded interaction potential energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique. Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD_Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the β-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD simulations. The calculated binding free energies of guest molecules with sufficient sampling agreed excellently with experimental data (\&lt; 1.0 kcal/mol error). In comparison with previous microsecond-timescale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers{\textquoteright} rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 μs simulations. The calculated ligand binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a promising approach for characterizing ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to facilitate computer-aided drug design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract={Methodologies on molecular docking are constantly improving. The problem consists on finding an optimal interplay between the computational cost and a satisfactory physical description of ligand-receptor interaction. In pursuit of an advance in current methods we developed a mixed docking approach combining ligand- and receptor-based strategies in a docking engine, where tridimensional descriptors for shape and charge distribution of a reference ligand guide the initial placement of the docking molecule and an interaction energy-based global minimization follows. This hybrid docking was evaluated with soft-core and force field potentials taking into account ligand pose and scoring. Our approach was found to be competitive to a purely receptor-based dock resulting in improved logAUC values when evaluated with DUD and DUD-E. Furthermore, the smoothed potential as evaluated here, was not advantageous when ligand binding poses were compared to experimentally determined conformations. In conclusion we show that a combination of ligand- and receptor-based strategy docking with a force field energy model results in good reproduction of binding poses and enrichment of active molecules against decoys. This strategy is implemented in our tool, LiBELa, available to the scientific community.},

abstract = {Abstract Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a robust computational method for simultaneous unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of biomolecules. It works by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD greatly accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude. Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates or collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained enhanced sampling and is advantageous for simulating complex biological processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a Gaussian distribution, thereby allowing for energetic reweighting via cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e., “Gaussian approximation”). This leads to accurate reconstruction of free energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid schemes with other enhanced sampling methods, such as the replica-exchange GaMD (rex-GaMD) and replica-exchange umbrella sampling GaMD (GaREUS), have also been introduced, further improving sampling and free energy calculations. Recently, new “selective GaMD” algorithms including the Ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and Peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD) enabled microsecond simulations to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of small-molecule ligands and highly flexible peptides. The simulations then allowed highly efficient quantitative characterization of the ligand/peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics. Taken together, GaMD and its innovative variants are applicable to simulate a wide variety of biomolecular dynamics, including protein folding, conformational changes and allostery, ligand binding, peptide binding, protein–protein/nucleic acid/carbohydrate interactions, and carbohydrate/nucleic acid interactions. In this review, we present principles of the GaMD algorithms and recent applications in biomolecular simulations and drug design.

ABSTRACT={The precise modeling of molecular interactions remains an important goal among molecular modeling techniques. Some of the challenges in the field include the precise definition of a Hamiltonian for biomolecular systems, together with precise parameters derived from Molecular Mechanics Force Fields, for example. The problem is even more challenging when interaction energies from different species are computed, such as the interaction energy involving a ligand and a protein, given that small differences must be computed from large energies. Here we evaluated the effects of the electrostatic model for ligand binding energy evaluation in the context of ligand docking. For this purpose, a classical Coulomb potential with distance-dependent dielectrics was compared with a Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model for electrostatic potential computation, based on DelPhi calculations. We found that, although the electrostatic energies were highly correlated for the Coulomb and PB models, the ligand pose and the enrichment of actual ligands against decoy compounds, were improved when binding energies were computed using PB as compared to the Coulomb model. We observed that the electrostatic energies computed with the Coulomb model were, on average, ten times larger than the energies computed with the PB model, suggesting a strong overestimation of the polar interactions in the Coulomb model. We also found that a slightly smoothed Lennard-Jones potential combined with the PB model resulted in a good compromise between ligand sampling and energetic scoring.}

    abstract = {Molecular docking is an important tool for the discovery of new biologically active molecules given that the receptor structure is known. An excellent environment for the development of new methods and improvement of the current methods is being provided by the rapid growth in the number of proteins with known structure. The evaluation of the solvation energies outstands among the challenges for the modeling of the receptor-ligand interactions, especially in the context of molecular docking where a fast, though accurate, evaluation is ought to be achieved. Here we evaluated a variation of the desolvation energy model proposed by Stouten (Stouten P.F.W. et al, Molecular Simulation, 1993, 10: 97–120), or SV model. The SV model showed a linear correlation with experimentally determined solvation energies, as available in the database FreeSolv. However, when used in retrospective docking simulations using the benchmarks DUD, charged-matched DUD and DUD-Enhanced, the SV model resulted in poorer enrichments when compared to a pure force field model with no correction for solvation effects. The data provided here is consistent with other empirical solvation models employed in the context of molecular docking and indicates that a good model to account for solvent effects is still a goal to achieve. On the other hand, despite the inability to improve the enrichment of retrospective simulations, the SV solvation model showed an interesting ability to reduce the number of molecules with net charge -2 and -3 e among the top-scored molecules in a prospective test.},
